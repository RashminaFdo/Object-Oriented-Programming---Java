# 💳 Banking App Tutorial - Java OOP Encapsulation

Welcome to the **Banking App** project! This repository serves as a practical tutorial for understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, specifically **Encapsulation**, in Java. The banking app allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and view account details.

## 🧑‍💻 What is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP. It is the practice of keeping fields (attributes) private within a class and providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify them. This helps to protect the internal state of the object and ensures that it is only modified in a controlled manner.

In this project:
- Account information is kept private.
- Methods are provided to interact with the account, like deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance.
